// Solutions: Merkle tree acumulators or Sharding and just do not store too much data
//Immutability: Smart contract updatable (delegate proxy pattern) to adapt to Government'waste management objectives.
//Privacy: use merkle root hash on the blockchain and keep the private data in a more tradiitonal database outside.
// Also, whio can be a node? Who has access to the blockchain
